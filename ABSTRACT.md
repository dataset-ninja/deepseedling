The authors of the **DeepSeedling** dataset emphasize the significance of plant population density in agricultural production systems, as it greatly influences crop yield and quality. They note that traditionally, estimating plant population density involves labor-intensive methods like field assessment or germination-test-based approaches, which can be prone to inaccuracies. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened up new possibilities for tackling complex computer vision tasks such as object detection. In this context, the authors set out to develop a deep-learning-based method for counting plant seedlings in field conditions.

Plant population density, crucial for agricultural production systems, is the measure of plant stands per unit area. The authors highlight its impact on crop yield potential and fruit quality, particularly during the critical seedling stage. They explain that current methods for estimating plant population density involve manually counting seedlings in randomly selected subareas of a field, with the average count used as a representation of the density.

The authors mention two common sampling methods: quadrat and plotless sampling, for counting seedlings within these subareas. They point out that while these methods are straightforward, they can be labor-intensive, especially for large fields, and may yield inaccurate results if not appropriately configured.

The proposed dataset is used for the evaluation of the model.
