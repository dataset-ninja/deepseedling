**DeepSeedling: Deep Convolutional Network and Kalman Filter for Plant Seedling Detection and Counting in the Field** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 5741 images with 33255 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *plant* and *weed*.

Images in the DeepSeedling dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 521 (9% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *UGA2015* (2389 images), *TAMU2015* (1821 images), and *UGA2018* (1531 images). Additionally, images contain ***id*** of each category. The dataset was released in 2019 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">The University of Georgia, USA</span>.
